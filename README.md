Much of this code is not mine, I get it from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGdFR9cpE6A&list=LL&index=1 and I intend to improve it.

Install:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NcAc-cAcN/atractores.git
cd atractores
```

To use:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```python
python3 main.py
```
